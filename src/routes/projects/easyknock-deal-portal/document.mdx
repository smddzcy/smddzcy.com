<h2>Context</h2>

EasyKnock lets people sell their homes, access the money they need and remain in their home as a tenant. Salespeople at EasyKnock were using a lot of mathematical formulas and algorithms to come up with fees, rent values, and more. They needed an easier and more reliable solution than Excel to crunch numbers.

<h2>Work</h2>

I developed an interactive dashboard backed with Node.js/PostgreSQL that has formula fields (just like Excel), input fields, and fixed fields. Formulas can be chained together and evaluated efficiently using graph algorithms (e.g. topological sort on [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)).
