"_Hello, World_". When a programmer starts learning a new language, it's the 2 magical words that must be printed on the screen. I think I have used these words more than I should, I have to stop somewhere but anyways, here is my start.

I closed my previous blog which was getting a bit messy and built this new one. It's fully open-source, and you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/smddzcy/smddzcy.com). This blog will be all about programming, tech, and some other mumbo-jumbo. Here I'll be sharing some of my works, tips & tricks, tutorials.

I don't tweet a lot these days, but if you want to talk, click this shiny little twitter link: **[@smddzcy](http://twitter.com/smddzcy)**. You can also send me an e-mail at; samedduzcay @t gmail d0t com. No spam, por favor. Gracias.

You can share your thoughts about the new design or anything else in the comment box below. Have a great day!
