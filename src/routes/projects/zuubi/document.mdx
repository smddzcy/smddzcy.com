<h2>Context</h2>

Zuubi is basically AirBnB for electric-car chargers. It lets electric-car owners find and book chargers easily, and lets charger owners rent their chargers.

<h2>Work</h2>

I developed all the technology behind the startup within 2 months:

* cross-platform mobile application with **React Native (Expo)**,
* REST API backend with **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, deployed to **AWS EC2**,
* static landing page, hosted on **AWS S3** and served with **AWS CloudFront**.
