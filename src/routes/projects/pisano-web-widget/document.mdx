<h2>Work</h2>

I was a Senior Software Engineer at Pisano, and I worked there for more than 2 years before I began freelancing. I built Pisano Web Widget, Pisano Analytics, and many other internal/external tools for Pisano. I built some of them by myself and some of them within a small and efficient team.
