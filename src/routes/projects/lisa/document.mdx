<h2>Context</h2>

Lisa is an application that uses machine learning to predict the number of likes a photo would get on Instagram. You choose a couple of photos, upload them to Lisa, and Lisa tells you which photo you should upload and why - it gives you the number of likes, how better the photo is compared to the others, and suggested hashtags.

<h2>Work</h2>

I was a co-founder at Lisa. Even though we were a small startup with a small team, we were processing terabytes of data every day. I built many parts of the tech stack including:

* cross-platform mobile application with **React Native**,
* REST API backend with **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, cached with **Redis**, deployed to **IBM Cloud**,
* messaging queue with **RabbitMQ**,
* big data and data-processing backend with **Hadoop**; specifically **Scala**, **Spark**, **HBase** (with **Phoenix**).
