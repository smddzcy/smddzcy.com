<h2>Context</h2>

Bartme is a barter platform for books. It lets you trade your books with other people using a virtual currency called *Barty*. Whenever you upload a new book, Bartme automatically suggests a price for your book depending on the condition, publication date, and other factors. You get 50% of the Barties when you upload your book and 50% when it finds a new owner, then use it to get books from the pool.

<h2>Work</h2>

I developed and deployed the mobile application with its backend within 2 months:

* cross-platform mobile application with **React Native (Expo)**,
* REST API backend with **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, deployed to **AWS EC2**.
