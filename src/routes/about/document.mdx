# About Me

I'm a software engineer, a web enthusiast, a traveler, a serious foodie... and many other things. But if I had to pick one, I'd call myself a _lifelong-learner_. I'm a truly passionate person about learning new things. But whatever I try to do, I just try to have fun. I think that's the only important thing.

I love startups. I worked at [one](https://www.pisano.co) for 3 years, had great friends there and a great experience. I also learned a lot, obviously. I joined Pisano not having any deep knowledge or experience in anything. I started working there knowing little about lots, then I left knowing lots about lots.

Then I interned at Google. Being a part of this software giant was a totally unique experience. I learned a lot about software-at-scale and more about making many engineers work together in perfect coordination. It was also a good experience for me to learn about how big companies keep their employees happy and help them achieve a good work-life balance.

Then I helped co-found [Lisa](https://asklisa.ai/), and left soon after seeing that it didn't work out the way I wanted. It was a promising idea, but it didn't progress well even though we worked really hard.

Now I build the new version of [Infoset](https://infoset.app/) and freelance on the side for [Christian Dior](https://www.dior.com/), [L'Oréal](https://www.loreal.com/), [EasyKnock](https://www.easyknock.com/), [DoNotPay](https://www.donotpay.com/parking/), and many other companies. 

Enough work topics. Outside of work, I [travel a lot](/travel-map).

I occasionally catch the aurora.

And enjoy the beautiful waters of Thailand.

But none is better than my home country, Turkey, if you're a foodie just like me. (you've probably heard of _salt bae_)

That's all about me. [Hit me up](https://twitter.com/smddzcy) if you're anywhere near Istanbul and just want to have a coffee ☕️
