Today I'm going to talk a little bit about **multithreading in Java**.

A *thread* is a small component of a *process*, that can run concurrently with the other components (threads). It differs from a *process* in several ways but the most important thing is; **threads share the same state, while processes are independent units**. This means that all threads of a process share the same process state, memory space and resources.

You can think of it as a worker, working in parallel with other workers. Let's say that your house needs painting. If you hire 1 worker, it'd take him 10 hours to paint the entire house. But if you hire 5 workers, and if all of them work concurrently on different parts of the house, it'd take only 2 hours. Also, they share the same resources (paint) and the same space (house). This is just how the threads work.

## Life Cycle of a Thread

A thread's lifecycle consists of different stages. For example; a thread *starts*, *waits* for another thread to perform a necessary task, *executes* its task, and *dies*. It can be in only one stage at a given time. The life cycle of a thread is controlled by JVM.

Here are the stages in detail:

- **New**: A *born thread*. It is the stage before the program starts the thread.
- **Runnable**: After the program starts the thread, it becomes *runnable*. It means that it is executing its task in JVM.
- **Non-Runnable (Blocked)**: The thread is still alive, but it is not eligible to execute its task. It is currently waiting for an object's monitor (for details: [Mutual exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion)). It mostly happens when the thread is waiting for access to synchronized code.
- **Waiting**: The thread is waiting for another thread to complete a task.
- **Timed Waiting**: The thread is waiting for another thread to complete a task, but up to a certain amount of time. It'll go back to runnable stage when that time interval expires or the other thread completes its task.
- **Terminated (Dead)**: The thread has completed its task or it is terminated.

Now, let's get to our main subject: *multithreading*.

Multithreading is the process of running multiple threads of a process at the same time. Let me start by creation of a thread.

## Creating a Thread

There are some useful methods of `Thread` class which we are going to use:

- `start()`: Begins the execution, JVM calls the run() method of this thread.
- `join()` or `join(long millis)`: Waits for the thread to die. The one takes an argument waits for a maximum of millis milliseconds. (if 0, waits forever - same as join())
- `setPriority(int newPriority)`: Sets the priority of this thread.
- `getPriority()`: Returns the priority of this thread. setName(String name): Sets the name of this thread.
- `getName()`: Returns the name of this thread.
- `isAlive()`: Returns a boolean indicating if the thread is alive or not.
- `stop()`: Stops the thread. This method *currently* exists but **don't use it to stop threads**, since it's deprecated and its usage is not recommended. If you want to stop a thread, see [Java docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/misc/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html).

### Option 1: Extending the Thread Class

It is as simple as extending the Thread class and overriding the run method. Example:

```java
private static class MyThread extends Thread {
    public MyThread(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " is running.");
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread t1 = new MyThread("Thread 1");
    Thread t2 = new MyThread("Thread 2");
    t1.start();
    t2.start();
}
```

Output:

```
Thread 1 is running.
Thread 2 is running.
```

### Option 2: Implementing the Runnable Interface

Actually, what we did above was just implementing the Runnable interface. It is also possible to explicitly implement that and create a Thread object with that implementation. The Thread class has a constructor which accepts a Runnable object. Example:

```java
private static class MyWorker implements Runnable {
    private String name;

    public MyWorker(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(name + " is running.");
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Runnable worker1 = new MyWorker("Worker 1");
    Runnable worker2 = new MyWorker("Worker 2");

    Thread t1 = new Thread(worker1);
    Thread t2 = new Thread(worker2);

    t1.start();
    t2.start();
}
```

Output:

```
Worker 1 is running.
Worker 2 is running.
```

There are also other ways to run these workers. One of them is creating a *thread pool*. I'm not getting into its details but here is a simple example with the same `MyWorker` class:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Runnable worker1 = new MyWorker("Worker 1");
    Runnable worker2 = new MyWorker("Worker 2");

    // This creates a fixed size thread poll.
    // You can also create a single thread executor with
    // \`Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()\` and an expandable
    // thread pool with \`Executors.newCachedThreadPool()\`
    ExecutorService e = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

    e.execute(worker1);
    e.execute(worker2);

    // Previously submitted tasks will be executed,
    // but no new tasks will be accepted after this.
    e.shutdown();
}
```

See for details: [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/pools.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/pools.html)

### Option 3: Using Anonymous Class

It is the dirty way of creating a thread. Same as option 2, but just *dirtier*. Example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is executing its task.");
            dummyTask();
            System.out.println("Thread is finished its task.");
        }

        private void dummyTask() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    });
    t.start();
    System.out.println("Test string");
}
```

Output:

```
Test string
Thread is executing its task.
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Thread is finished its task.
```

## Thread Priority

We say that all threads run concurrently; but in reality, it is not the case. It feels like it is a concurrent environment, but your system cannot run all of your threads simultaneously. There is a **thread scheduler** in JVM that decides which thread to run, based on many factors including *priority*. Every thread in Java has a priority between `MIN_PRIORITY` and `MAX_PRIORITY`. If you don't set it, its default is `NORM_PRIORITY`.

```java
/**
 * The minimum priority that a thread can have.
 */
public final static int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;

/**
 * The default priority that is assigned to a thread.
 */
public final static int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;

/**
 * The maximum priority that a thread can have.
 */
public final static int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;
```

It *hopefully* determines the order of execution of the threads; however, **it doesn't guarantee it**. As I've said, it's just one of those *many factors*. Example of thread priority:

```java
private static class MyThread extends Thread {
    public MyThread(String name, int priority) {
        setName(name);
        setPriority(priority);
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        dummyJob();
        System.out.println(getName() + " is finished.");
    }

    private String dummyJob() {
        String s = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            s += "dummy";
        }
        return s;
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread t1 = new MyThread("Priority:1", 1);
    Thread t2 = new MyThread("Priority:5", 5);
    Thread t3 = new MyThread("Priority:10", 10);

    t1.start();
    t2.start();
    t3.start();
}
```

Output:

```
Priority:10 is finished.
Priority:5 is finished.
Priority:1 is finished.
```

This is it for now. Next time I'll get into the details of multithreading and talk about **java.util.concurrent** package. Have a great day!
