Building React apps is super easy now - thanks to tools like `create-react-app`, but deploying them can still be tricky depending on the platform. I usually use PaaS solutions like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to easily deploy my PoC applications with a single command, and use AWS to deploy my production applications. But I was forced to use Azure for my last few projects and it was a bit tricky to use. I'm gonna share **how to deploy a Node + React application on Microsoft Azure** today.

## Building a React Application

Nowadays, building a React app has become super easy. You don't have to deal with hundreds of lines of Webpack configuration. You don't have to think about how to optimize your CSS/JS/images, or your chunks, or anything else. The team behind `create-react-app` or other tools like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) takes care of all of those things for you.

I usually use `create-react-app` since I don't use fancy new stuff like CSS-in-JS (how do you handle caching with this?) or Server-side Rendering (SSR), so I'm going to use that here as well. First, create your app:

```bash
create-react-app NewAzureApp
```

We're going to let Node serve both our React application and the backend API, so let's add the dependencies for a basic Node API:

```bash
cd NewAzureApp
npm install -S express body-parser cors helmet morgan
```

Create a file called `app.js` at the project root:

```bash
touch app.js
```

Then implement a basic API:

```js
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const cors = require('cors');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const logger = require('morgan');

function normalizePort(val) {
  const port = parseInt(val, 10);
  if (Number.isNaN(port)) { return val; }
  if (port >= 0) { return port; }
  return false;
}

const app = express();

app.use(cors({ credentials: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(helmet());
app.use(logger('dev'));

// Add your API routes under the route `/api`
const api = require('./api');
app.use('/api', api);

// Serve the React application
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
});

const port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || 3000);
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`API listening on port: ${port}`);
});
```

Now when you build your React application and run `app.js`, it will automatically serve your app + API together:

```bash
npm run build
node app.js
# go to localhost:3000 to see your React app
# you can also access your API endpoints from localhost:3000/api
```

## Deploying Your Application on Azure

First, you have to create a file called `web.config` to tell Azure how to run your application. Here's my `web.config` that includes the configuration for Node + React + socket.io (I use it quite often).

```xml
<!-- web.config -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
 <system.webServer>
 <webSocket enabled="false" />
 <handlers>
    <add name="iisnode" path="app.js" verb="*" modules="iisnode"/>
  </handlers>
 <rewrite>
  <rules>
    <rule name="StaticContent">
      <action type="Rewrite" url="build{PATH_INFO}" />
    </rule>
    <rule name="DynamicContent">
      <match url="/api/*" />
      <action type="Rewrite" url="app.js"/>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Socket.io polling">
      <match url="/socket.io/*" />
      <action type="Rewrite" url="app.js"/>
    </rule>
    <rule name="Socket.io websocket">
      <match url="/sockjs-node/*" />
      <action type="Rewrite" url="app.js"/>
    </rule>
    <rule name="React Routes">
      <match url=".*" />
      <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="True"/>
        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="True"/>
        <add input="{REQUEST_URI}" pattern="/api" negate="true" />
      </conditions>
      <action type="Rewrite" url="build/" />
    </rule>
  </rules>
 </rewrite>
 <security>
    <requestFiltering>
      <hiddenSegments>
        <remove segment="bin"/>
      </hiddenSegments>
    </requestFiltering>
  </security>
  <httpErrors existingResponse="PassThrough" />
 </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

Now we have a running Node + React app that's also configured for Azure, it's time to deploy. Go to Azure and create a `Web App`.

<img src={azureWebapp} title="Azure Web App" className="mb-175" />

You have 2 options to deploy your app on Azure:

1. Using [FTP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-ftp)
2. Using [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops)

I'm not going to explain the FTP option because it's pretty straightforward: just upload your whole application using any FTP client to the given server.

For Azure Pipelines (my preferred way), you have to create an `azure-pipelines.yml` at the project root. It's a file that basically tells Azure how to build your application:

```yaml
resources:
- repo: self
  fetchDepth: 1

pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu 16.04'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '10.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    npm install
    npm run build
  displayName: 'npm install and build'

- script: |
    zip -r result.zip . -x .git/**\* > /dev/null
  displayName: 'package results'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathtoPublish: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/result.zip' 
    artifactName: 'drop' 
  displayName: 'upload artifacts'
```

Now go to your webapp, then go to `Deployment Center` under `Deployment` menu, and click `Edit`. You will be redirected to the Azure Pipelines page, where you will see a tab called `Triggers`. Go there to create your build triggers, so that your pipeline runs every time you push a commit to a specific branch.

This is it. After you make another push to your Git remote (e.g. GitHub), your project will be automatically built and deployed. Now you can have a drink and enjoy your Node API + React app on Azure. Let me know if you have any questions, and have a great day.
