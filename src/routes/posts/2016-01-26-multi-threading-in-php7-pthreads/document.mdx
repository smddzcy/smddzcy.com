Almost a year ago, I came across with this **pThreads** extension. It's an extension that makes it possible to create multi-threaded applications in PHP, and I completely fell in love with it! It is not some bullshit like forks; it gives you the ability to use real POSIX threads.

> Absolutely, this is not a hack, we _don't_ use forking or any other such nonsense, what you create are honest to goodness POSIX threads that are completely compatible with PHP and safe ... this is true multi-threading :)

As I said before, you'll be amazed by its speed and easy-to-use structure. Let's start.

Installing
----------

It's a PECL extension. If you have PECL, you can install directly with it.

```bash
pecl install pthreads
```

Or you can install via Homebrew on macOS.

```bash
brew install php70-pthreads
```

After installation, check the output of `php -m`. You probably won't see pThreads there, which means you should add its extension declaration to your `php.ini` to enable it. You have to add something like `extension="PATH-TO-EXTENSION-FILE/pthreads.so or .dll"` and restart your server. If your server fails to start - which is normal - look for the error it gives. It will say something like this for Apache:

```
PHP Fatal error: The apache2handler SAPI is not supported by pthreads
PHP Fatal error: Unable to start pthreads module in Unknown on line 0 Unknown(0) : Fatal error - The apache2handler SAPI is not supported by pthreads Unknown(0) : Fatal error - Unable to start pthreads module
```

It's because pThreads only works on the CLI side with the recent versions, and you have to disable it for your web server. Make a copy of your php.ini file in the same directory with the default one, name it `php-cli.ini`, then delete the `extension="PATH-TO-EXTENSION-FILE/pthreads.so or .dll"` declaration from the default `php.ini` file. Try to start your server again; now there shouldn't be any problem.

Usage
-----

Let's look at this simple example.

```php
<php

class SomeThreadedClass extends Thread
{
    private $tID;
    public $data;

    public function __construct(int $tID)
    {
        $this->tID = $tID;
        $this->data = $tID . ":" . date('H:i:s');
    }

    public function run()
    {
        echo $this->tID . " started.\n";
        sleep($this->tID);
        echo $this->tID . " ended. " . date('H:i:s') . "\n";
    }
}

$threads = [];

for ($i = 1; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $threads[$i] = new SomeThreadedClass($i);
    $threads[$i]->start();          // start the job on the background
}

for ($i = 1; $i < 5; $i++) {
    $threads[$i]->join();           // wait until job is finished, 
    echo $threads[$i]->data . "\n"; // then we can access the data
}
```

Create a class that extends `Thread`, and override the `run` method. It's simply all it takes to get a threaded PHP object.

```php
$threads[$i]->start();
```

This line, the start method, initiates the thread and starts executing your object's run method.

```php
$threads[$i]->join();
```

When your thread finishes its task, you can reach to your object after calling the join method. Output of the code above:

```
1 started.
2 started.
3 started.
4 started.
1 ended. 18:18:52
1:18:18:51
2 ended. 18:18:53
2:18:18:51
3 ended. 18:18:54
3:18:18:51
4 ended. 18:18:55
4:18:18:51
```

It looks totally satisfying, doesn't it ? I suggest you to take a look at its documentation & great examples on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/krakjoe/pthreads). There is also a php.net documentation: [http://php.net/manual/en/book.pthreads.php](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pthreads.php)
