It's a very natural need: providing your application in different languages. I will try to look at 2 popular i18n libraries for React today, and discuss the pros and cons of each option.

> Since internationalization is a **veeeery** long word, I'll abbreviate it to "i18n". Localization can also be considered long, so it'll be abbreviated to "l10n".

## Option 1: react-intl

### Popularity

- **Weekly downloads from npm:** 371,603
- **Dependent npm packages:** 1,451
- **GitHub stars:** 9,875
- **Issues:** 189

As of writing this, `react-intl` looks like the most popular choice for i18n in React. It has a huge user base with almost 400k downloads per week. It also has lots of examples and articles online.

### Features

It is a huge library that does both i18n and l10n. It formats dates, numbers, and strings, including pluralization and handling translations. It probably has everything you need from an i18n/l10n library:

- Display numbers with localized separators
- Display localized dates and times
- Pluralize labels in strings
- Support for lots of (150+) languages
- Runs in the browser and Node.js
- Follows the standards

### How to Use

Install the library:

```bash
npm install -S react-intl
```

Wrap your application with `IntlProvider` providing the user's locale and translations for that locale:

```jsx
import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl';

// ...

const usersLocale = 'en';
const translationsForUsersLocale = {
  'blog.title': `Blog of {whom} - {viewCount, number} {viewCount, plural,
    one {view}
    other {views}
  }`
};

ReactDOM.render(
    <IntlProvider
        locale={usersLocale}
        messages={translationsForUsersLocale}
    >
        <App/>
    </IntlProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Then use `FormattedMessage` to translate, pluralize, format strings:

```jsx
import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';

<FormattedMessage
  id="blog.title"
  values={{ whom: 'Samed DÃ¼zÃ§ay', viewCount: 5000 }}
/>
// => Blog of Samed DÃ¼zÃ§ay - 5,000 views
```

There are also other components like `FormattedHTMLMessage`, `FormattedNumber`, `FormattedDate`... and more to localize other forms of strings. You can check all of those and more from the official docs: https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/wiki

One small note: By default, `react-intl` only contains the locale data for English, but it provides a simple API to add locales as needed:

```jsx
import { addLocaleData } from 'react-intl';
import en from 'react-intl/locale-data/en';
import fr from 'react-intl/locale-data/fr';

addLocaleData([...en, ...fr, ...es]);
```

### Pros/Cons

It is a very scalable i18n solution, but IMHO it's not an easy-to-use one. Its API is a bit complex - maybe even too complex for small and mid-size projects. I'd recommend `react-intl` for big projects where you need a complete &amp; scalable localization system.

+ **+** Complete localization solution
+ **+** Support for many locales
+ **+** Scalable, flexible
+ **-** Hard to use

## Option 2: react-i18next

### Popularity

- **Weekly downloads from npm:** 186,357
- **Dependent npm packages:** 444
- **GitHub stars:** 3,222
- **Issues:** 2

It is also a super popular choice for i18n with almost 200k downloads per week, and again, you can find lots of tutorials and examples online.

### Features

It's a smaller library than `react-intl`, but as far as I've seen it's **really** flexible and it does the job just as well.

- Built on top of a core that's really flexible
- Pluralize labels in strings
- Support for multiple languages
- Runs in the browser and Node.js
- Follows the standards

### How to Use

New version of `react-i18next` supports React Hooks (yay ðŸŽ‰) so you have 2 ways: you can use the hook `useTranslation` for your functional components and use the HOC `withTranslation` for your old &amp; bulky class components. I'm going to be using the hook version for the examples, but the HOC version is just as simple to use.

Install the libraries:

```bash
npm install -S i18next react-i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector
```

Create a file called `i18n.js` and configure the library:

```jsx
// i18n.js
import i18n from 'i18next';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';

i18n
  // detect user language
  // learn more: https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  // pass the i18n instance to react-i18next.
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    debug: true,
    // I'm hardcoding the translations here for the sake of simplicity,
    // but in a real-world application you would get these from a backend.
    // i18next has a small plugin that makes it easy.
    // learn more: https://github.com/i18next/i18next-xhr-backend
    resources: {
      'en':{
        'translation': {
          test: 'Test translation'
        }
      }
    },
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false, // not needed for React as it escapes by default
    },
});
```

Import the `i18n.js` from your `index.js` so it gets bundled:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

import './i18n'; // <-----

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Now you can use the hook or the HOC easily in any component. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

function Page() {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();

  const changeLanguage = lng => {
    i18n.changeLanguage(lng);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="App-header">
        <button onClick={() => changeLanguage('de')}>de</button>
        <button onClick={() => changeLanguage('en')}>en</button>
      </div>
      <div>{t('test')}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

const Loader = () => (
  <div className="App">
    <div>loading...</div>
  </div>
);

// here Suspense shows the Loader in case translations are not yet loaded
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
      <Page />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

`useTranslation` hook gives you an object with 2 important keys:

- `t`: It's a function that takes a translation key and returns the translated message. In our case above, `t('test')` returns our translation `Test translation`.
- `i18n`: It's an object with a very important function in it, `changeLanguage`. It's pretty self-explanatory; you can change the language by using that function.

### Pros/Cons

It is a very simple i18n solution that's also very flexible.

+ **+** Extremely easy-to-use i18n solution
+ **+** Support for many locales
+ **+** Scalable, very flexible
+ **-** Not as complete as `react-intl`

---

All in all, I think `react-i18next` is a simpler &amp; more developer-friendly library that can also be used in very big projects thanks to its flexibility and simple API. As of writing, `react-i18next` is my go-to i18n solution for all of my projects.
